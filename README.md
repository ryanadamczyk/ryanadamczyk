#  ðŸ‘‹  Greetings!

My name is Ryan Adamczyk, and I'm presently pursuing my Masters while working as an IT Specialist at Florida Atlantic University. I currently hold a Bachelors of Business Administration in Management Information Systems with a concentration in Business Analytics. 

I am a HomeLab enthusiast who is constantly tinkering to learn more about my areas of interest. 

At 22 years old, I am an aspiring technology professional eager to make a significant entrance into the IT field, with a keen interest in roles such as Systems Administrator or equivalent.
